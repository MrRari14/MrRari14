<h1>Hi! I'm Bernardo!</h1>

<ul>
  <li> 👋 I usually go by Mr.Rari online and use the Rari Corporation as a front for my personal projects.</li>
  <li> 👀 I code now after an on/off relationship with SmallBasic, HTML & CSS, Python and JavaScript.</li>
  <li> 🌱 My main focus now is ReactJS since I love the frontend specialization and JavaScript.</li>
 </ul>
 
 I've recently discovered Vercel ❤️

<h1>Hi! I'm Bernardo!</h1>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
  <li> 👋 I usually go by <strong>bernardukiii</strong> online and use the <strong>bdki Corporation</strong> as a front for my personal projects.</li>
  <li> 👀 I code now after an on/off relationship with <strong>SmallBasic, HTML & CSS, Python and JavaScript</strong>.</li>
  <li> 🌱 My main focus now are <strong>ReactJS</strong> & <strong>NextJS</strong> since I love the frontend specialization, and <strong>JavaScript libraries altogether</strong>.</li>
  <li>I also like tampering with alertnatives like Svelte (using SvelteKit)</li>
 </ul>
 
 I've discovered Vercel ❤️ a while back and am in love with it ever since. Most of my projects are hosted there, including <a href="https://bdki-portfolio.vercel.app">my portfolio!</a>

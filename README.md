<h1>Hi! I'm Bernardo!</h1>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
  <li> 👋 I usually go by <strong>Mr.Rari</strong> online and use the <strong>Rari Corporation</strong> as a front for my personal projects.</li>
  <li> 👀 I code now after an on/off relationship with <strong>SmallBasic, HTML & CSS, Python and JavaScript</strong>.</li>
  <li> 🌱 My main focus now is <strong>ReactJS</strong> since I love the frontend specialization, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</li>
 </ul>
 
 I've recently discovered Vercel ❤️
 
 My goals for 2023?
 <ul>Learn TypeScript</ul>
 <ul>Improve ReactJS knowledge</ul>
 <ul>Get Linux certified</ul>
